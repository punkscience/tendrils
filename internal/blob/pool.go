// Pool spreads blob operations across several Blossom servers, trying them in
// configured order until one answers. It satisfies the same interface as a single
// Client, so the engine is unaware there is more than one.
//
// This is failover, deliberately not mirroring. An upload goes to the first
// server that accepts it, not to all of them, so the pool buys reachability
// rather than redundancy. Two things follow, and both are intended:
//
//   - Order is preference. Put the closest or least restricted server first. A
//     LAN server ahead of a proxied public one means large files skip the proxy's
//     request-size cap, and a laptop that leaves the network still syncs — it just
//     falls through to the next server.
//   - A reader must try every server, because any one of them may be the only one
//     holding a given blob.
//
// Unreachable servers are remembered briefly. Without that, a laptop away from
// its LAN would pay the dial timeout on every single operation before falling
// through, which is slower than having no LAN server configured at all.
