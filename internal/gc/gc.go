// Package gc reclaims Blossom blobs no live file event references any more.
//
// Nothing in Tendrils has ever deleted a blob. Every edit of a file publishes a
// new blob and abandons the old one, and two now-fixed bugs multiplied that
// enormously: sealing used a random nonce (so the same content re-uploaded as a
// fresh blob every time) and a `created_at` mistake made losing devices republish
// forever. The result on the author's own store was 926 GB of blobs for a 181 GB
// tree — 80% of it garbage, and a full disk that stopped all syncing.
//
// Deleting data is the one operation here that cannot be undone by syncing again,
// so this package is built to refuse rather than guess. Four rules:
//
//   - **The keep-set comes from the relay, not from one device.** A blob is live
//     if any current file event references it. A single device's index only knows
//     what that device synced.
//   - **A partial view never deletes.** If the relay fetch fails, or returns
//     implausibly less than the device already knows about, the sweep aborts. A
//     truncated keep-set would classify live blobs as orphans — precisely the
//     failure that makes GC dangerous.
//   - **Recent blobs are untouchable.** An upload whose describing event has not
//     propagated yet looks exactly like an orphan. A grace period covers that gap.
//   - **Other tenants are untouchable.** A Blossom server may hold blobs this
//     identity did not upload, and stored blobs carry no owner attribution. So
//     unless the operator declares the store single-tenant, a candidate is deleted
//     only once it is *proven* ours by decrypting under our key — an AES-GCM tag
//     no other key can forge.
//
// Invalid blobs are the one exception to the keep-set: a blob too short to be a
// sealed blob at all cannot be the bytes its address claims, so it is deleted
// even when referenced. Keeping it would be worse than deleting it — while it
// sits there the server reports the blob as present, every upload is skipped, and
// the file it belongs to can never be repaired.
